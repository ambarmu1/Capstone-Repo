The components will then be compared between the two cities to understand their similarity and identify food venue characteristics using a descriptive approach. Where data may not be complete for the entire area of the cities, a sample may be used. The types of existing venues and their traffic will be used to determine the likelihood for a new business owner to open up an establishment in their geographic area.",
